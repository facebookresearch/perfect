# PERFECT: Prompt-free and Efficient Few-shot Learning with Language Models
This repo contains the PyTorch implementation of Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Luke Zettlemoyer, james Henderson, Marzieh Saeidi, Lambert Mathias, Veselin ‪Stoyano, and Majid Yazdani [PERFECT: Prompt-free and Efficient Few-shot Learning with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01172), ACL 2022.

For any questions, please contact the first author([email](mailto:rkarimi@idiap.ch)) or leave issues.





# Installation 
```
conda create --name perfect python=3.8
python setup.py develop 
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# data pre-processing 
For SST-2, SST-5, CR, MR, Subj, TREC datasets, we used the datasets from Gao et al. ACL 2021 ([paper][lm-bff-paper]),
which are processed as below, for other datasets we used the huggingface datasets, which automatically get downloaded:
```
wget https://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/projects/lm-bff/datasets.tar
tar xvf datasets.tar
rm datasets.tar 
mv original/ datasets
python process_datasets.py
rm -r datasets 
```

# How to run the models
We provide the example scripts to run each model in the paper in `fewshot/scripts`
folder with their config files in `fewshot/configs`. To run the models, please do `cd fewshot` and run:
**Please note on top of each script, I wrote how we modified the hyper-parameters**
